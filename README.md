Built on [openpgpjs](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs), pgp.js is a simple utility for encrypting and decrypting PGP messages entirely in your browser, without compromising your privacy.

## ToDo

- Add support for signature and verification
- Move encryption functions to service
- File support (?)
